# FindMyBuddy

FindMyBuddy is a web application that allows users to connect with their lost old friends from their school days. By registering and providing their details and school information, users can find and reconnect with fellow schoolmates who have also registered on the platform. This project was developed by Vishal Ola and Sahil Yadav.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their personal details and school information.
- School-based Connections: Upon registration, users can view a list of other registered users who attended the same school.
- Contact Details: Users can access the contact details of fellow schoolmates, allowing them to initiate communication.
- User Profile: Each user has a profile page where they can update their personal information and manage their account settings.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: The frontend of FindMyBuddy is built using React.js with Material UI and Tailwind CSS, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- Backend: The backend is powered by Express.js, a flexible Node.js web application framework. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- Deployment: The server is hosted on Render, providing a reliable hosting solution, while the frontend is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast and efficient delivery of the user interface.
